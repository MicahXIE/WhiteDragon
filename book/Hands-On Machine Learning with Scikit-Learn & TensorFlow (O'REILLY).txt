1. Machine Learning Definition

[Machine Learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
—Arthur Samuel, 1959

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
—Tom Mitchell, 1997



2. There are four major categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semisupervised learning, and Reinforcement Learn‐ ing.



3. Supervised Learning
Supervised learning, the training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired
solutions, called labels

1) A typical supervised learning task is classification.
2) Another typical task is to predict a target numeric value, such as the price of a car, given a set of features (mileage, age, brand, etc.) called predictors. This sort of task is called regression 

some of the most important supervised learning algorithms (covered in this book):
• k-Nearest Neighbors
• Linear Regression
• Logistic Regression
• Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
• Decision Trees and Random Forests
• Neural networks2




4. Unsupervised Learning
In unsupervised learning, as you might guess, the training data is unlabeled

some of the most important unsupervised learning algorithms:
• Clustering
— k-Means
— Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) — Expectation Maximization
• Visualization and dimensionality reduction — Principal Component Analysis (PCA) — Kernel PCA
— Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE)
— t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
• Association rule learning
